# Project 4 - Daily Dids (D2)
#### By Brian Anderson

## Project Summary

I'm building a daily did app - that is a tracker for what i did to keep growing per Alex's markdown.  It incorporate all 7 restful routes.  My goals for this app are
1. Responsive 
2. Track what was done
3. Keep me growing/learning code, so i will one day be the big CHEESE

## Models

I believe there is just one.  I would like to add one or two more once I complete this project.

## Route Table

List your routes in a table

| url | method | action |
|-----|--------|--------|
| /dids | get | get all "dids" (index)|
| /dids/:id | get | get a particular did (show)|
| /dids/new | get | show "add new" did form  (new)|
| /dids | post | add the new did to database (create)|
| /dids /:id/edit| get | show form to edit existing did  (edit)|
| /dids/:id | put | change database to update did (update)|
| /dids/:id | delete | remove the did from database (destroy)|

## User Stories
Our user is someone who aspires to be CHEESY (Alex Merced)...but isn't there yet. Our user needs to follow AM's advice and continue to put in the 8 hours a day to get there.  Our user will:
- add did's to the list as necessary
- add or edit did's/minutes if desired
- delete did as they want
- see all the dids done to make sure the user is on track to make Cheddar ($) to deposit in users Swiss bank account.
## Challenges
So i had a few challenges.  
•  I attempted a dropdown and I am almost there using this tutorial(https://www.newline.co/@andreeamaco/react-dropdown-tutorial-for-beginners-create-a-dropdown-menu-from-scratch--9831d197)  I am really close to making it work.</br>
•  I wanted a stopwatch kind of timer...click a button that starts the clock ticking...then a stop button with a capture button to auto-calculate the time spent on that area.  again, i attempted it and I am learning...but not there yet.  </br>
•  used this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DwGahSqcEc) to help build my modal...with some changes. </br>
•  my biggest fail is the css...i spend a crap-ton of time trying to fix...rather than just doing my own.  This will be my first project post graduation.</br>
